          <h3>Academic Interests</h3>
          <p>
            At ITAM, where I am pursuing dual bachelor's degrees in Economics and Data Science, I have developed a solid foundation in economic theory and quantitative analysis.
          </p>
          <p>
            Through my coursework and projects, I have explored how data science can drive innovative solutions for pressing issues like environmental conservation and community development. As a research assistant at ITAM, I’ve had the privilege of working on projects that evaluate the impacts of environmental policies and support sustainable development.
          </p>
          <p>
            My fieldwork with ejido communities in Hidalgo was particularly meaningful, as it allowed me to connect directly with people, translating complex policy frameworks into actionable strategies tailored to their needs.
          </p>
          <p>
            I am particularly proud of the projects I’ve undertaken, such as designing Python-based data pipelines for analyzing environmental taxes and economic indicators. These experiences have helped me see the transformative power of technology when applied to societal issues.
          </p>
          <p>
            As an active member of the Data Science Student Council, I’ve enjoyed fostering collaboration and driving meaningful projects among my peers. I also find great fulfillment in giving back through tutoring and offering aid lessons in various subjects, helping others achieve their academic goals.
          </p>
          <p>
            I am excited to continue leveraging my skills to try and make a positive impact.
